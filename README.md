# Prusa-Mini-Revo
a modified heatsink for the Prusa Mini with support for the E3D revo nozzle breaks and heatercores

When E3D came out with the Revo system it had a kit for the Prusa Mini available not long after, sadly this was just their Revo Micro with a printed bracket. There is nothing wrong with that, I just wanted something a bit more OEM looking. With the Mini and Mini+, Prusa gave us .STEP files for the hotend that I brought into Fusion360 and spent far too much time trying to figure out how to modify for my needs, 9 iterations later, I have one that I like and am using on my daily driver mini.

This *should* work with the original fan duct of the Mini/Mini+, but I haven't tested it, I've only used it with this CFD optimised fan duct from Printables (https://www.printables.com/model/192627-prusa-mini-cfd-optimized-fan-duct).

In keeping with the E3D revo system, this is open source, GPL V3, i've supplied the .f3d , .step and .obj files, as well as a technical drawing for the screw holes if you want to send it off to PCBWay etc to get it made like I did.
